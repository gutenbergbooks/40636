<h2 class="sans">THE ADVENTURES OF PICKLOCK HOLES.</h2>

<h4>(<i>By Cunnin Toil.</i>)</h4>

<h3>No. VII.&mdash;THE STOLEN MARCH.</h3>

<h4>(<i>Continued.</i>)</h4>

<p>As soon as we entered the drawing-room
all the little <span class="sc">Gumpshons</span> clapped
their hands with delight, and surrounded
their Uncle <span class="sc">Picklock</span>, each
of them attempting to infer from the
expression on the great detective's
countenance what it was that he
carried in his left coat-tail pocket.
"I know what it is," said <span class="sc">Edgar
Allan Poe Gumpshon</span>, a boy of
fifteen; "it's plum-cake. I know
it must be, because I never seed it,
so it ain't seed-cake." <span class="sc">Gaboriau
Gumpshon</span>, aged thirteen, opined it
was a packet of bull's-eyes, "'cos
that's what detectives always carry
on dark nights," whilst <span class="sc">Ann Radcliffe
Gumpshon</span> declared with certainty
that it must be nuts, for she
had just heard a cracker explode in
the street. "Children," said <span class="sc">Picklock
Holes</span>, "you are nearly right.
Your powers have much improved.
I am delighted to see that you are
kept up to the mark;" and, speaking
thus, he produced from his pocket an
apple, which he presented to <span class="sc">Edgar</span>,
a pocket-knife which he handed to
the jubilant <span class="sc">Gaboriau</span>, and a pincushion,
which was immediately
clasped and carried off in the chubby
hand of little <span class="sc">Ann Radcliffe</span>. "A
year ago," said <span class="sc">Picklock</span>, turning to
me, "these children could not have reasoned inductively with one
half of their present approximate accuracy; but my dear sister,
Heaven bless her! is a wonderful teacher, the best and cleverest of
us all. Indeed, indeed you are, <span class="sc">Philippa</span>," he continued, warmly
embracing Mrs. <span class="sc">Gumpshon</span>. "I am a mere bungler compared to you.
But come, let us to business." At a signal from Lady <span class="sc">Holes</span> the
happy children trooped off to bed, and we elders were left alone.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">Aminadab</span> opened the conversation. "I sent for you, my dear
boy," he said, "because I have just received from one of my agents
in the North information of an important case which demands
immediate investigation. Neither <span class="sc">Hayloft</span> nor <span class="sc">Skairkrow</span> can go,
having business that keeps them in London. I look, therefore, to
you to cover the family name with new lustre by solving this extraordinary
mystery." Here the old man paused, as though overcome
by emotion. <span class="sc">Picklock</span> encouraged him with an expressive look, and
he continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This morning," he said, "I received from my agent this letter."
He drew a sheet of paper from his breast-pocket, and read, in
tremulous tones, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indr">"'<i>Tochtachie Castle, Daffshire.</i></p>

<p>"'<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;Lord <span class="sc">Tochtachie</span> has been robbed. I overheard him last
night conversing with the Hon. <span class="sc">Ian Strunachar</span>, his eldest son,
who used the following words: "Not a doubt of it. They have
stolen a march&mdash;&mdash;" More I could not hear at the moment. The
case is of immense importance, and I trust you will lose no time in
sending a competent investigator. I have, of course, concealed
both my presence here and my knowledge of the theft from his
lordship.</p>

<p class="author1">"'Yours faithfully,</p> <p class="author">'<span class="sc">David McPhizzle</span>.'"</p>

<p>"There, my boy, is the case. Will you go and help a Scotch representative
peer to recover his own? Think how terrible it must be
to lose the march or boundary that separates your ancestral domain
from that of a neighbour whose whole course of life may be antipathetic
to you. Will you go?"</p>

<p>A wave of emotion passed over my friend's face. I could see that
a struggle of no ordinary kind was raging in his breast. Finally,
however, he looked at me, and his mind, I knew, was made up. In
another ten minutes we had bidden adieu to his family, and were
speeding northwards in the Scotch express.</p>

<p>Over the details of the journey it is not necessary to linger. Suffice
it to say that on the following morning we arrived at Tochtachie,
and took up our quarters in a deserted barn situated in the very
centre of the estate. From this point we pursued our investigations.
Our first proceeding was to interview the local constabulary, but we
found them as obtuse and as foolishly incredulous as policemen are
all the world over. One of them, indeed, went so far as to hint
that <span class="sc">Holes</span> was "havering," which
I understand to be an ancient Gaelic
word signifying metaphysical talk,
but a look from the great detective
chilled him into silence. Day by
day we worked, and not even the
night gave us a rest from our self-sacrificing
labours. We mapped out
the whole district into square yards;
we gathered the life-history of every
single inhabitant on the estate; we
left no clue untracked, no loophole
unblocked, no single piece of evidence
unexamined, no footstep unmeasured.
We collected every scrap of torn
letter, every crumpled telegram-form.
The very heather of the moor,
and the trees growing in the policies
of the Castle were compelled by
<span class="sc">Holes'</span> marvellous inductive powers
to yield to us their secrets, until
after weeks of patient toil we at last
judged ourselves to be in possession
not only of the stolen march, but
also of evidence that would bring
conviction home to the guilty party.
We had paused, I remember, by a
heap of granite at the roadside.
<span class="sc">Holes</span> seemed strangely excited.
"A march," I heard him muttering,
"is performed by footsteps; steps
are often made of stone. Can this be
it? It must be! It is!" Then,
with a shout of triumph, he gave
orders to have the heap loaded on to
a country cart, which was to follow
us to the Castle.</p>

<p>We arrived in the great courtyard
at about seven o'clock in the evening.
<span class="sc">Holes</span> slipped from my side, entered
the house, and after a few moments returned to my side. We then
clanged the bell, and demanded to see his lordship. In a few moments
Lord <span class="sc">Tochtachie</span> appeared, surrounded by kilted retainers, bearing
torches, and intoning in unison the mournful sporan of the clan. It was
a weird and awful sight. But <span class="sc">Holes</span>, unemotional as ever, advanced at
once to the haughty Scotchman, before whose eye half a county was
accustomed to tremble, and, without any ado, addressed him thus:
"My Lord, your march has been stolen. Nay, do not interrupt me.
Your guards are careless, but not criminal&mdash;of that I can assure you.
Here is the stolen property; I restore it to you without cost." At
this moment the cart rumbled up, and ere the peer had time to utter
a word, it had discharged its contents into the middle of the yard.
<span class="sc">Holes</span> went on, but in a lower voice, so as to be heard only by Lord
<span class="sc">Tochtachie</span>: "The guilty party, my Lord, is your honoured father-in-law.
He dare not, he cannot, deny it. He is, I know, blind and
deaf and dumb. These qualities do not, however, exclude the possibility
of crime. I have just found these pieces of granite in his
morning-room. The proof is complete."</p>

<p>At this moment a shot was heard in the Castle, and directly
afterwards a frightened butler rushed up to his lordship and
whispered to him. "Ha! say you so?" almost screamed Lord
<span class="sc">Tochtachie</span>. "That amounts to a confession. Mr. <span class="sc">Holes</span>," he
continued, "you have indeed rendered me a service. My unfortunate,
but guilty father-in-law has shot and missed himself through the
head. But in any ease the honour of the house is, I know, safe in
your hands."</p>

<p>I need hardly say that <span class="sc">Holes</span> has never violated his lordship's
confidence, and the Daffshire peasants still speculate amongst
themselves upon the tortuous mystery of the march which was stolen
and restored.</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;There is no proof positive given by any eye-witness whose veracity
is unimpeachable of the death of the great amateur detective as it has been
described in the <i>Strand Magazine</i> for this month. <i>Where is the merry Swiss
boy who delivered the note and disappeared?</i> What was the symbolic meaning
of the alpenstock with the hook at the end, left on the rock? Why, that
he had <i>not</i> "taken his hook." <span class="sc">Picklock Holes</span> has disappeared, but so
have a great many other people. That he will turn up again no student of
detective history and of the annals of crime can possibly doubt. Is it not
probable that he has only dropped out of the <i>Strand Magazine</i>? And is it
not equally probable that under some alias he will re-appear elsewhere?</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Friday, December 22.</i>&mdash;House adjourned for
Christmas Recess; pleased to find that it will include the whole
of Christmas Day. Some talk of being satisfied with the Sunday,
spending Christmas Day in further pursuit of Parish Councils
Bill. But after deliberation decided to have a real good holiday
on Christmas Day. Came across <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> just now.
Was chalking up on door "Back in ten minutes."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/302b-600.png"><img src="images/302b-300.png" width="300" height="286" alt="Toby, M.P., enjoys his holiday." /></a>
<p class="center">Toby, M.P., enjoys his holiday.</p></div>

<p>"It's a little more than that, of course, <span class="sc">Toby</span>," he said. "But
that has business-like look. Am told it's what they do in the City
before going out for
hasty luncheon."</p>

<p class="center">The last I saw of Harcourt.</p></div>

<p>Enjoyed my holiday
reading <span class="sc">Herbert Maxwell's</span>
life of <span class="sc">Old
Morality</span> just published
by <span class="sc">Blackwood</span>.
A difficult task; much
easier to make attractive
book out of life of
<span class="sc">Napoleon Bonaparte</span>
than with <span class="sc">William
Henry Smith</span> as subject.
That <span class="sc">Maxwell</span>
has succeeded appears
from fact that one leaves
these volumes with
warmer esteem and sincerer
liking for <span class="sc">Old
Morality</span> even than was
born of close observation through many Parliamentary sessions.
<span class="sc">Maxwell</span> has had full access to his correspondence and journals.
Uses them with great discretion; they bring into mellow, clear
light the capable, unselfish, courageous man, ever following the
loadstar of Duty. House of Commons used to smile when <span class="sc">Old
Morality</span>, faced by any difficulty or dilemma, talked about his
"duty to his <span class="sc">Queen</span> and country." In his private letters he does
not put it in that oratorical form. But they are full of references to
the calls of duty. Stricken with a painful malady, worn in body
and wounded in spirit, <span class="sc">Old Morality</span> still sturdily trod the narrow
path. There is little doubt
that had he, two years before
the end came, retired from the
Leadership of the House of Commons
his genial presence might
have been with us to-day. But
he was wanted at his post, and
he stuck to it.</p>

<p>Writing on the 17th March,
1889, he says: "We have trouble
in politics, and I am very weary.
But I must go on doing my daily
work as best I can, looking for
guidance and wisdom where alone
it can be had until my rest comes."
This cry for rest was always
sounding, through day and night.
A few weeks earlier he wrote to
another friend: "I can say God
help me. He will take me out of
my work when I am no longer required,
and then will come rest."</p>

<p>His last appearance in a semi-official
capacity was in July, 1891,
when he went to Hatfield to meet
the German Emperor. In the last
letter written to his wife he says,
"Observing I looked tired last
night, Lady <span class="sc">Salisbury</span> urged me
to go to bed early: which I did."
One of his colleagues in the
Cabinet, a fellow-guest at Hatfield
on this occasion, tells me he
had occasion to know that <span class="sc">Old
Morality</span> was in such pain he
could not rest in his bed, spending the long night walking about the
room, with occasional rest in an arm-chair. Not a word of this is
written in the letter to Mrs. <span class="sc">Smith</span>, in which he reports that
"everything has gone off wonderfully well to-day, which must be
very satisfactory to the Salisburys." Under his bourgeois habit and
unassuming manner <span class="sc">W. H. Smith</span> modestly hid a chivalrous mind
and a noble nature. He had a kindly heart, too. But everyone
knew that, since he wore it on his sleeve.</p>

<p class="clear"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Adjourned for so-called Christmas holidays.
Think I'll go and call on Lobengula. "Back in ten minutes," as the
<span class="sc">Squire</span> says.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<h3>EDEPOL!</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;"I'm all the way from Westminster," and the work I have
to do is to let you know about the Latin play performed there.
<span class="sc">Plautus</span>, in truth, is not a wildly exciting writer, and there is in the
<i>Trinummus</i> a tameness which, extending, as it does, through
five acts, becomes almost oppressive at the end. The young actors
looked well and enunciated clearly, and one of them, Mr. <span class="sc">J. F.
Waters</span>, showed considerable ability as an actor. But we don't go
to the College of St. Peter at Westminster merely to see the play.
There are other interests. It is pleasant to watch the Old Westminsters
rubbing recollections with one another between the acts,
and endeavouring gallantly during the performance to keep their
rusty Latin abreast of the various situations. Laughter in a Latin
play straggles. It is like a dropping fire of musketry. A Westminster
master probably leads it off; various intelligent veterans
take it up dutifully, and the ladies, bless their unlatinised minds,
follow faintly towards the end. If a London manager wants
applause in his theatre let him hire a contingent of small Westminster
boys. They have attained to absolute perfection in the arts
of the <i>claque</i>. At no Paris Theatre is it better done. The epilogue
showed a pretty wit and a high degree of skill in the management
of hexameter and pentameter. No one could have believed that the
Kodak advertisement, "you press the button, we do the rest," would
have made so good a Latin line. Much pleased, and so to bed.</p>

<h4>(<i>An Incident.</i>)</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Scene I.</span>&mdash;<i>Library in Latterday Hall</i>, Sir <span class="sc">Lyon Taymer's</span>
<i>Country House</i>. Sir <span class="sc">Lyon Taymer</span> <i>discovered fuming by the mantelpiece,

<p><i>Sir Lyon.</i> You know how anxious I am that my New Year's party
should be a success. A whole heap of celebrities are coming, and,
notwithstanding the immense expense, I engaged a party of Ghosts
to amuse them. Now I have just had a telepathic communication
from these Shadows of Shades&mdash;(that's all they are&mdash;only Ghosts of
departed heroes and heroines in fiction)&mdash;asking whether they're to
be treated on an equality with the other guests, or as mere entertainers!
Did you ever hear of such impertinence! The spokesman&mdash;I
should say, perhaps, the Spooksman&mdash;is,
of all people in the other
world, the <span class="sc">VICAR OF WAKEFIELD</span>.
A clergyman too! It's quite inconsistent;
and so snobbish!</p>

<p><i>Secretary.</i> Dear Sir <span class="sc">Lyon</span>, excuse
me, but it's perfectly natural that
Ghosts should be a little sensitive
on the social question. Remember,
for years they were ignored, or
looked upon as mountebanks. It is
really only of late that there has
been all this excitement about
them, so it is not surprising they
are anxious to be taken seriously.</p>

<p><i>Sir Lyon.</i> Well, I suppose I am
old-fashioned, but it seems to me
quite ridiculous. These infernal
Ghosts give themselves as many airs
as though they were&mdash;the Blue
Hungarians, at least.</p>

<p><i>Secretary.</i> Ah, from a band we
might expect airs. But I should
advise you very strongly, Sir <i>Lyon</i>,
to treat them as friends. You <i>must</i>
be up to date.</p>

<p><i>Sir Lyon</i> (<i>with disgust</i>). Allow
them to dine&mdash;perhaps to <i>dance</i>&mdash;with
my guests?</p>

<p><i>Secretary</i> (<i>with calmness</i>). Certainly
they will have to dine; and,
as to dancing, of course they <i>must</i>,
if they're received on an equal
<i>footing</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>Smiles to himself at
his joke.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir Lyon.</i> Oh&mdash;well&mdash;I suppose
I must give in. Let them know
at once, and for heaven's sake mind
they're punctual.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>Scene closes as the Secretary
hastily seizes a slate, and
automatically writes to the
Ghosts a very cordial and
courteously-worded invitation.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sc">Scene II.</span>&mdash;<i>New Year's Eve at Latterday Hall. In the magnificent
dining-room are seated at dinner a large, well-known, and incongruous
company. The Ghosts are chatting away in the most
genial manner with the living distinguished people, and
positively making the "celebrities" quite "at home."</i> <span class="sc">Daniel
Deronda</span> <i>shows a marked liking for</i> <span class="sc">Dodo</span>, <i>whom he has
taken
to dinner, and is indulging in a light and airy flirtation with her,
which takes a form peculiar to himself</i>.</p>

<p class="center">Dorian Gray taking Juliet in to dinner.</p></div>

<p><i>Daniel Deronda</i> (<i>earnestly</i>). Who has ever pinched into its
pilulous smallness the cobweb of matrimonial duty? Honesty is
surely the broadest basis of joy in life.</p>

<p><i>Dodo</i> (<i>a modern Detail in accordion pleating, subject to morbid fits
of irrelevant skirt-dancing</i>). Oh, Mr. <span class="sc">Deronda</span>, what a silly girl I
am! I can't bear that proverb about "Honesty being the best
policy." It sounds like a sort of life Insurance.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>Giggles contemporarily.</i> <span class="sc">Dorian Gray</span> <i>having taken</i> <span class="sc">Juliet</span> <i>to
dinner, and not getting on with her very well, is staring with
unfeigned horror at</i> <span class="sc">Rochester</span>, <i>opposite, who is bullying</i> <span class="sc">Jane
Eyre</span> <i>to a pitiable extent. Behind him is a screen of gilt
Spanish leather, wrought with a rather florid Louis Seize
design and encrusted with pearls, moonstones, and large green
emeralds</i>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Dorian</i> (<i>aside, to</i> Young Subaltern, <i>who has come Home. On
leave. For Christmas</i>). Who <i>is</i> that dreadful man?</p>

<p><i>Young Subaltern.</i> Who? Old <span class="sc">Rochester</span>? Oh, he's a Plain
Hero. From the past. He's all right. How well you're looking!
Younger than ever, by Jove! Which is curious. But why that
absurd buttonhole?</p>

<p><i>Dorian</i> (<i>hurt</i>). You never like anything I wear. You Anglo-Indians
are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>Arranges his fringe in an old Dutch-silver mirror on the
opposite mantelpiece, framed in curiously-carved ivory
Cupids, and studded with precious stones, chiefly opals,
sapphires, and chrysoberyls.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Ethel Newcome</i> (<i>to</i> Secretary). Who are those two pretty American
girls? They seem to be attracting a great deal of attention. (<i>I</i> am
completely forgotten, I notice.) Do their dresses come from Paris?</p>

<p><i>Secretary.</i> No. I think not, dear Miss <span class="sc">Newcome</span>. From Messrs.
<span class="sc">Howells and James</span>, I fancy.</p>

<p><i>Richard Feverel</i> (<i>cheerily, across the table to</i> Mr.
<span class="sc">Pickwick</span>). In
tolerance of some dithyrambic inebriety&mdash;quiverings of semi-narration&mdash;we
seem to be entering the
circle of a most magnetic pseudo-polarity.
Don't we?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Pickwick</i> (<i>puzzled</i>). Very
kind of you to say so, I'm sure.
May I have the pleasure of taking
wine with you?</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>Dinner proceeds with animation.</i>
<span class="sc">Bootles</span>' Baby, Little
<span class="sc">Jim</span>, <span class="sc">Paul Dombey</span>, <i>and
the</i> Heavenly Twins <i>come
in to dessert, and are more
or less troublesome</i>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir Lyon</i> (<i>aside, to</i> Secretary,
<i>when the ladies have retired</i>). I say,
you know I am afraid this is going
to hang fire. It's nothing less than
a miracle for a social affair to go off
well when the people are not in the
same set. Old <span class="sc">Pickwick</span>'s been
asking for "a wassail bowl." I
haven't got such a thing about
me; and I should have thought
'74 champagne would have been
good enough, but he says it's
like our humour&mdash;<i>too new</i>! The
children are bothering to know why
there isn't a Christmas-tree.</p>

<p><i>Secretary.</i> Tell them to go to the&mdash;Haymarket.
The reward will be&mdash;swift.
Might I suggest mistletoe?
I should be very pleased to go under
it with Madame <span class="sc">Bovary</span>, just to
show the others how to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Lyon</i> (<i>stiffly</i>). Much obliged,
but I will not give you that trouble.
If <i>anyone</i> goes under the mistletoe
with Madame <span class="sc">Bovary</span> it will be
myself. Remember that.</p>

<p><i>Secretary.</i> Oh, certainly! I
merely meant&mdash;&mdash;How about
crackers? I could set the thing
going by pulling one with Miss
<span class="sc">Olivia</span>. The old Vicar said just
now, in his pointed, Gothic way,
something about times having changed, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Lyon.</i> Yes, we'll have crackers, but you can leave <i>me</i> to pull
the first one with Miss <span class="sc">Olivia</span>. It would look better. Perhaps we'd
better let the Ghosts give their entertainment now&mdash;eh?</p>

<p><i>Secretary.</i> I'll arrange it at once.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Scene III.</span>&mdash;<i>In the Hall, in which is a temporary theatre; all the
Modern Celebrities are seated on rows of chairs, chattering,
flirting, and discussing Insomnia and the New Criticism. Behind
the scenes the Ghosts are disputing as to which shall recite
first, the order of precedence depending entirely on the question as
to which is the most completely defunct. Finally</i>, <span class="sc">Ernest Maltravers</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="sc">Tom Jones</span> <i>go on together, and the Curtain goes up</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ernest Maltravers</i> (<i>musingly, in a low yet ringing voice, in which
Pride struggles with Emotion</i>). Let us learn, from yon dinner-table,
o'er which brooded the spirits of the Novelists of all time, to lift
ourselves on the wings of Romanticism back to Bombastic and Primeval
Prose. (<i>Breaks off suddenly. Aside, to</i> <span class="sc">Tom Jones</span>.) I cannot
go on like this. We ought to have had a <i>scenario</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tom Jones</i> (<i>suppressing laughter, aside</i>). Why, thou foolish
scoundrel, is there not one in front? How else could be seated
there so many fair ladies and gallant gentlemen?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg 305]</span>

<p><i>Ernest Maltravers</i> (<i>aside</i>). In the contemplation of your idiocy, I
curb with difficulty the impulse that leads me to crush the life from
your bosom. Know, Ignorant One, that a <i>scenario</i> is not the same
thing as an auditorium.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<span class="sc">Tom Jones</span> <i>is about to attack him with fine old English violence,
when the curtain suddenly falls. The entertainment is interrupted.
The audience appear at once amused and shocked.</i>
<span class="sc">Dorian</span><i> takes out his little vinaigrette exquisitely set with
turquoises, cymophanes, amethysts, and tourmalines, and
offers it to the</i> Subaltern, <i>who, evidently unaware of its
use, pockets it.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Subaltern.</i> You got that out of a cracker, didn't you? I'll take
it Home. For the kids.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>The entr'acte is growing so prolonged that the</i> Secretary <i>goes
behind the scenes to know the cause of the delay. He finds
all confusion. The party has been increased by the presence
of</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Stead's</span> Spook <span class="sc">Julia</span>, <i>who, having half an hour to
spare, has come to protest against the "indignity" as she
calls it, of fine old crusted Ghosts being expected to perform
to a lot of mere modern myths. She speaks with such
eloquence that she persuades them, one and all, to leave
without finishing their performance and entirely without
ceremony. Nothing the</i> Secretary <i>can say has any effect,
and they all vanish, leaving "not a wrack behind," except,
a slate pencil <span class="sc">Julia</span> has dropped in her excitement</i>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir Lyon</i> (<i>after hearing the news</i>). Shameful! Never again will
I have a Ghost in this house. This is what comes of treating them
as equals! I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;I'll write to the Psychical Society!</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>"Sir," said a wisely deferential friend of the Baron's, approaching
the Baronial arm-chair wherein sat His Super-Excellency
regaling himself in truly Regal-Cole-ian fashion, "Sir, I present to
your notice a book entitled <i>In Search of a Climate</i>." "With such
a title," quoth the Baron, in poetic humour, "it should have been
dedicated to His Grace of Canterbury. Would not this distich well
favour the title-page? Listen:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="distich" align="center" border="0">
<tr>
       <td class="left1">"'In Search of a Climate,'</td>

       <td class="left">Who lives in a cottage."</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>"W. A.," or "The Wisely Appreciative," went into wisely
appreciative ecstasies. "Baron," he presently resumed, "you will
be graciously pleased to read it." "I will recline on my sofa," returned
the Baron, "and, in that position, do my level best." So
saying, His Super-Excellency suited the action to the word, and,
waving his hand in token that he was not to be disturbed for the
space of some forty winks or more, he bent his head in silent study
o'er the somewhat bulky volume. "One of the most interesting
and instructive chapters in this excellently elaborated book of
reference," said the Baron, some time afterwards&mdash;"a book full of
'wise saws and modern instances'&mdash;is that headed 'Religion and
Rum,' whence it appears that, whatever form of worship the Natives
from time to time might adopt, it always included the cult of spirits
in some form or other. The title of this chapter," observed the
Baron, judicially, "instead of 'Religion and Rum,' should rather
have been 'Rum Religions, or Spirituous Influences.' Towards the
close of the book the author still seems to be <i>In Search of a Climate</i>.
But what sort of a climate does he seek? One to suit everybody?
Why, like the distinguished individual who was 'terribly disappointed
with the Atlantic,' there are people, quoted as testimony
above proof by Mr. <span class="sc">Nottage</span>, of the Cottage, who were 'all terribly
disappointed with the climate of Santa Barbara and Los Angeles.'
Well, then," quoth the Baron, "try Margate and Ramsgate." The
book, attractively got up, is published by the firm whose name
always recalls to the Baron's verse-atile mind that delightful poem
set to dulcet music yclept "<i>Soft and Low, Soft and Low</i>," only
that the names are <span class="sc">Samp-son</span> Low, Low &amp; Co., which, set to the
same strain, will "do as well." "And," quoth the Baron, suddenly
inspired, "what a series of songs for Publishers and Bookbinders
might be written! For example, <i>'My Mother bids me bind my
books!' 'I am inter-leaving thee in sorrow.' Cum multis aliis
suggestionibus!</i> But this is <i>délassement</i>. Let our toast be, 'Our
noble Shelves!'&mdash;'our noble Book-shelves!'" explains the Baron,
gaily; and so back to the Brown Study where, as Baron <span class="sc">Brown
Beard</span>, he disposes of the various heads in his department, and signs
himself, <span class="sc">The Just and Generous Baron de Book-Worms</span>.</p>

<h2>"THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT."</h2>

<p>(<i>Passages from a Political "Christmas Carol" of the Period descriptive
of a slumbering Stateman's Yule-Tide Dream.</i>)</p>

<p>Awaking in the middle of a prodigiously sonorous snore, and
sitting up on what seemed to be a nightmare-like blend of the
Treasury Bench and his own bed, to get his thoughts together,
<span class="sc">Sadstone</span> (like <i>Scrooge</i>) had no occasion to be told that Big Ben
was again upon the stroke of Twelve.</p>

<p>Now, being prepared for almost anything&mdash;from <span class="sc">J-ss-e C-ll-ngs</span>
to a Vote of Censure&mdash;he was not by any means prepared for
Nothing! Consequently, when the bell boomed its twelfth stroke,
and nothing appeared, or happened&mdash;not even a nightmare in the
shape of <span class="sc">T-mmy B-wl-s</span>, or a Motion for Adjournment&mdash;he was
taken with a fit of the shivers.</p>

<p>At last he began to think that the source and centre of the ghostly
light which seemed to gleam on him from nowhere in particular,
might be in the adjoining room, his own private Downing Street
<i>sanctum</i>. Thence indeed, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine.
This idea taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and
shuffled in his slippers to the door.</p>

<p>The moment <span class="sc">Sadstone's</span> hand was on the lock, a strange voice
called him by his name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.</p>

<p>It was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had
undergone a surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were
so hung with shamrock green and shillelagh branches that it looked
a perfect Grove of Blarney. A lurid blaze, like a blue-tongued
snapdragon flare, went hissing up the chimney, revealing in weird
glimpses on the heated hearth and chimney tiles spectral figures of
impish design and menacing gesture. Heaped up on the floor, to form
a kind of throne, were Blue Books, abortive Bills, scrolls on which were
inscribed endless questions and unnumbered amendments; bundles
of party papers and political pamphlets; pallid sucking-pigs that
seemed to demand rather opportune interment than human digestion;
long wreaths of sausage-like shackles; resurrection pies of indigestible
crust and full of offal scraps and tainted "block ornaments";
pudding-shaped bombs; barrels of explosives and fulminants;
red hot (political) "chestnuts" of the most hackneyed
partisan sort; Dead-Sea apples of the dustiest kind, savouring of
sand and strife; fiery looking Ulster oranges; belated (parliamentary)
pairs, and seething bowls of raw and vitriolic party spirit, that
made the chamber dim, dank, and malodorous with their heady
steam. In uneasy state upon this extraordinary conglomerate couch
or throne, there sat an ogreish giant of pantomimic size and
bogeyishly menacing expression, portentous to see; who bore a
smokily-flaring torch, in shape not unlike an Anarch's beacon or
Fury's bale-fire, and held it up, high up, to shed its lurid light on
<span class="sc">Sadstone</span>, as he came peeping round the door.</p>

<p>"Come in!" exclaimed the Ghoul-Ghost. "Come in, and know
me better, (G. O.) Man!"</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sadstone</span> entered timidly, and hung his head before the Spirit.
He was hardly the dogged <span class="sc">Sadstone</span> he had been, and the Spirit's
eyes were so glowering and ungenial, he did not like to meet
them.</p>

<p>"I am the Spirit of Christmas Present," said the apparition.
"Look upon me!"</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sadstone</span> sorrowfully did so. It was clothed in one simple
emerald-green robe or mantle, bordered with buff fur of the dull
tint dear to the old Scotch Whig. This garment hung so loosely on
the figure that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be
warded or concealed by any artifice. On its head it wore no other
covering than a wreath of shamrock, set here and there with a
thistle. Its dull black curls were long and elf-like and weird;
weird as its frowning face, its staring eye, its clenched hand, its
raucous voice, its despotic demeanour, and its gloomy air. Girded
round its middle was an antique scabbard, holding a huge two-handed
sword; the blade, ready to leap from its sheath, seemed a
most unsuitable and unseasonable adjunct to what mankind has
been wont to regard as the gentle and genial Spirit of Peace and
Goodwill.</p>

<p>"You have never seen the like of <i>Me</i> before!" exclaimed the
Spirit.</p>

<p>"<i>Ne-e-ver!</i>" <span class="sc">Sadstone</span> made answer to it, in accents stammering
somewhat, yet most emphatic.</p>

<p><i>is New Year's Eve. In a comfortable
arm-chair by the fire sits
the</i> Metropolitan Magistrate. <i>He
smiles in self-complacency. He
speaks:&mdash;</i></p>

<p>This year I have most faithfully
fulfilled my duty; the spirit of
sweet leniency has marked my
every sentence&mdash;at least toward the
more flagitious and inhuman
offender. Thus have I, in place
of punishing, won over to more
virtuous ways; so may I doze the
cheerful, self-admiring doze of
virtue.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>He dozes. Gathering from the
comfortable reflections of the
fire and lamp thrown from
the polished furniture, a
radiant form shapes itself at
his elbow. The</i> Magistrate
<i>smiles in his sleep, in great
content</i>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Metropolitan Magistrate.</i>
Who art thou, visitant?</p>

<p><i>The Form.</i> I am the Spirit of
thy Leniency. I come to show
thee how fair and flattering a result
thy milder sentences&mdash;to wit, those
passed upon the more outrageous
culprits&mdash;have yielded. See!
(<i>Waves a wand.</i>) This is he who
came before thy judgment seat for&mdash;after
repeated warning&mdash;selling
milk from premises teeming with
scarlet fever. Thou didst say,
"<i>It is the grossest, and most shocking
case of brutal disregard for human life I ever heard!</i>" and
thereupon didst fine him half-a-crown&mdash;the minimum penalty.</p>

<p><i>M. Mag.</i> (<i>with affectionate interest</i>). And since? How farest
now, thou naughty one?</p>

<p><i>Milk Criminal.</i> O most blessed Magistrate and sweet Your
Worship, I fare most happily; for, most comfortably encouraged
by your gracious leniency, I did redouble&mdash;nay, multiply an
hundred times&mdash;mine efforts to disseminate disease; so that I may,
without undue boasting, claim to be father of an epidemic that
felled its hundreds. And further, in the doing of this I have
heaped up a most goodly pile of gold. Give me your blessing, most
sympathetic Your Worship!</p>

<p><i>M. Mag.</i> (<i>recoiling</i>). Nay; mine intentions looked not toward so
dire result! I cannot bless&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Spirit.</i> How, good Stipendiary? Dost thou now disown me,
thine own Spirit? Thou must surely bless thy <i>protégé</i>, him who
but carries out thy methods to their logical result! And see, I
summon others of thy choice; this good butcher who hath sent
unwholesome meat to London to feed the poor. Thou didst say
of him, "<i>A most inhuman, ill-conditioned knave and rascal; a
constructive homicide! I will not imprison him, but fine him seven
shillings.</i>" And again, see this good rough who kicked a
constable nearly to death; thou saidst of him, "<i>A miscreant unfit
to live. A savage worse than any tiger! One shilling fine.</i>" Then
finding he could not pay without foregoing his accustomed gin, thy
heart relented, and thou didst discharge him. Then again, here
have we this fair hawker who kicked his donkey's legs and so belaboured
him with cudgels that he left no bone unbroken; thou
saidst of him, "<i>An act more horrible and sickening could scarce be
perpetrated by a fiend!</i>" Then, with a gentle caution, thou didst
set him free.</p>

<p><i>M. Mag.</i> But tell me, prithee, what the outcome was of these my
leniences. Did results not justify&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>The Butcher.</i> Oh, yes, indeed, in my case! Taking courage,
seeing that justice was so linked with mercy, I did extend most
energetically my little venture in unwholesome meat, and now am
rich, and have been made a lord.</p>

<p><i>The Rough.</i> And since your clemency, O sweet your Worship,
I've kicked to death some dozens of assorted victims&mdash;policemen,

<p><i>The Hawker.</i> And I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>M. Mag.</i> (<i>writhing</i>). Oh, peace, and spare me! Get ye gone!</p>

<p><i>The Criminals.</i> What? This is passing strange! You will not
bless the work yourself have fostered?</p>

<p><i>M. Mag.</i> (<i>tearing his hair</i>). <i>I</i> fostered? <i>I</i>, the

[<i>With a shriek the</i> Metropolitan Magistrate <i>awakes from his

<p>What are these hideous crimes that I have done, mistaking them
for mercy? How unworthy am I to touch so sweet an attribute,
distorting and most basely turning it from its appointed course!
There chime the bells. Let them proclaim how, in the coming year
they usher in, I will essay to win this fair, sweet attribute entrusted
to me, and so misshapen by my cruelties, back to her rightful form!
I will begin by showing mercy unto Mercy's self.</p>

<h3>A STUDY IN BROWN.</h3>

<div class="poem2">  <div class="stanza">
<p>I've caught you, hazel-eyed brunette, day-dreaming, chin on hand!</p>
<p>Don't think, now, that my stolen sketch is bold and contraband!</p>
<p class="i2">Nay, rather, 'tis the <i>duty</i> that's imposed on ev'ry beauty,</p>
<p>To grant that with respectful glance her profile may be scanned.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/309b-400.png"><img src="images/309b-200.png" width="200" height="329" alt="" /></a></div>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>To picture such a wealth of brown would <span class="sc">Vandyck's</span> self delight;</p>
<p>Brown eyes I see, and waving hair, brown as a summer night.</p>
<p class="i2"><i>I</i> cannot do you justice, but this thumb-nail sketch, I trust, is</p>
<p>A deep brown-study rendered into simple black and white.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>In reverie reflective, has your wayward fancy strayed,</p>
<p>It may be, to last summer's tryst in some wild English glade,</p>
<p class="i2">Or old-world forest-garden, where, like <i>Rosalind</i> in Arden,</p>
<p>Your troth you plighted, or, love-lorn, outmourned the Nut-brown Maid?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>You're wand'ring in Mahatma-land, and counting astral sheep?</p>
<p>And gathering wool that never grew, a Brownie-led <i>Bo-peep</i>,</p>
<p class="i2">Or, possibly, pursuant of an Ego playing truant.</p>
<p>And lost amid the labyrinth of dim hypnotic sleep?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>For all I know, you're musing in this meditative trance</p>
<p>On modern and sublunar joys, as dinner, dress, and dance!</p>
<p class="i2">Or is it <i>toothache</i> merely that&mdash;well, makes you stare so queerly?</p>
<p>(Somehow I ne'er <i>can</i> draw the line 'twixt bathos and romance!)</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>If thus I seem inquisitive, don't kill me with a frown!</p>
<p>Though times are hard, in vulgar phrase, I'll plank my money down!</p>
<p class="i2">Your train of thought to share (if you'll accept a penny-tariff),</p>
<p>I tender, with my compliments, the coin that's called a "brown"!</p>

<h3>PRODIGIOUS!</h3>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">To MR. Punch</span>,&mdash;Sir,&mdash;I appeal to you. Ought scientific papers
to be allowed to publish incitements to bloodshed and anarchy?
I have just read in one an enthusiastic commendation of "an agitator
working at 280 revolutions per minute." This agitator is,
it appears, closely connected with an "annihilator." It is true that
the annihilator is a smoke-annihilator, and the agitator is part of
its machinery; but who knows what influence may be exerted upon
weak minds at such a time as this by the use of these awful terms?
Is the Home Secretary asleep?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mysterious.</span>&mdash;In <i>Sala's Journal</i> for December 13 the advertisement
of the Christmas Number announces that "arrangements
have been made for publishing the Portraits of the Contributors at
the commencement of their respective articles. This, it is believed,
will prove a very interesting feature." No doubt. But <i>which</i>
"feature," and <i>whose</i> "feature," and to which contributor will
"the very interesting feature" in the portrait belong? They
cannot surely have only one feature among them! Among the
special contributors, each of course with distinctive features, are
Sir <span class="sc">Augustus Harris</span>, Mr. <span class="sc">Sutherland Edwards</span>, Mr. <span class="sc">Arthur
à Beckett</span>, and Mr. <span class="sc">Davenport Adams</span>. Excellent company each,
with most interesting features. But which feature is to be taken as
representing the lot? "Nose?" Well, there's point in that.
"Cheek?" Ahem! Will it be "All their eye?" Evidently the
only way of satisfying curiosity is to purchase a copy of <i>S. J.'s</i>
Christmas Number.</p>

As great care has been taken to imitate a
really first-class piece of furniture by a good

wood is certain to split and warp, that the
drawers jam, that the keyholes are dummies,

shoddy, will escape the attention of the
average purchasing idiot. What offers?</p>
