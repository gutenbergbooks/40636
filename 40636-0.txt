THE ADVENTURES OF PICKLOCK HOLES.

(_By Cunnin Toil._)

No. VII.--THE STOLEN MARCH.

(_Continued._)

As soon as we entered the drawing-room all the little GUMPSHONS
clapped their hands with delight, and surrounded their Uncle PICKLOCK,
each of them attempting to infer from the expression on the great
detective's countenance what it was that he carried in his left
coat-tail pocket. "I know what it is," said EDGAR ALLAN POE GUMPSHON,
a boy of fifteen; "it's plum-cake. I know it must be, because I never
seed it, so it ain't seed-cake." GABORIAU GUMPSHON, aged thirteen,
opined it was a packet of bull's-eyes, "'cos that's what detectives
always carry on dark nights," whilst ANN RADCLIFFE GUMPSHON declared
with certainty that it must be nuts, for she had just heard a cracker
explode in the street. "Children," said PICKLOCK HOLES, "you are
nearly right. Your powers have much improved. I am delighted to see
that you are kept up to the mark;" and, speaking thus, he produced
from his pocket an apple, which he presented to EDGAR, a pocket-knife
which he handed to the jubilant GABORIAU, and a pincushion, which was
immediately clasped and carried off in the chubby hand of little ANN
RADCLIFFE. "A year ago," said PICKLOCK, turning to me, "these children
could not have reasoned inductively with one half of their present
approximate accuracy; but my dear sister, Heaven bless her! is a
wonderful teacher, the best and cleverest of us all. Indeed, indeed
you are, PHILIPPA," he continued, warmly embracing Mrs. GUMPSHON. "I
am a mere bungler compared to you. But come, let us to business." At
a signal from Lady HOLES the happy children trooped off to bed, and we
elders were left alone.

Sir AMINADAB opened the conversation. "I sent for you, my dear boy,"
he said, "because I have just received from one of my agents in
the North information of an important case which demands immediate
investigation. Neither HAYLOFT nor SKAIRKROW can go, having business
that keeps them in London. I look, therefore, to you to cover the
family name with new lustre by solving this extraordinary mystery."
Here the old man paused, as though overcome by emotion. PICKLOCK
encouraged him with an expressive look, and he continued:--

"This morning," he said, "I received from my agent this letter." He
drew a sheet of paper from his breast-pocket, and read, in tremulous
tones, as follows:--

  "'_Tochtachie Castle, Daffshire._

"'SIR,--Lord TOCHTACHIE has been robbed. I overheard him last night
conversing with the Hon. IAN STRUNACHAR, his eldest son, who used the
following words: "Not a doubt of it. They have stolen a march----"
More I could not hear at the moment. The case is of immense
importance, and I trust you will lose no time in sending a competent
investigator. I have, of course, concealed both my presence here and
my knowledge of the theft from his lordship.

  "'Yours faithfully, 'DAVID MCPHIZZLE.'"

"There, my boy, is the case. Will you go and help a Scotch
representative peer to recover his own? Think how terrible it must
be to lose the march or boundary that separates your ancestral
domain from that of a neighbour whose whole course of life may be
antipathetic to you. Will you go?"

A wave of emotion passed over my friend's face. I could see that
a struggle of no ordinary kind was raging in his breast. Finally,
however, he looked at me, and his mind, I knew, was made up. In
another ten minutes we had bidden adieu to his family, and were
speeding northwards in the Scotch express.

Over the details of the journey it is not necessary to linger. Suffice
it to say that on the following morning we arrived at Tochtachie, and
took up our quarters in a deserted barn situated in the very centre of
the estate. From this point we pursued our investigations. Our first
proceeding was to interview the local constabulary, but we found them
as obtuse and as foolishly incredulous as policemen are all the world
over. One of them, indeed, went so far as to hint that HOLES was
"havering," which I understand to be an ancient Gaelic word signifying
metaphysical talk, but a look from the great detective chilled him
into silence. Day by day we worked, and not even the night gave us
a rest from our self-sacrificing labours. We mapped out the whole
district into square yards; we gathered the life-history of every
single inhabitant on the estate; we left no clue untracked, no
loophole unblocked, no single piece of evidence unexamined, no
footstep unmeasured. We collected every scrap of torn letter, every
crumpled telegram-form. The very heather of the moor, and the trees
growing in the policies of the Castle were compelled by HOLES'
marvellous inductive powers to yield to us their secrets, until after
weeks of patient toil we at last judged ourselves to be in possession
not only of the stolen march, but also of evidence that would bring
conviction home to the guilty party. We had paused, I remember, by a
heap of granite at the roadside. HOLES seemed strangely excited. "A
march," I heard him muttering, "is performed by footsteps; steps are
often made of stone. Can this be it? It must be! It is!" Then, with
a shout of triumph, he gave orders to have the heap loaded on to a
country cart, which was to follow us to the Castle.

We arrived in the great courtyard at about seven o'clock in the
evening. HOLES slipped from my side, entered the house, and after
a few moments returned to my side. We then clanged the bell, and
demanded to see his lordship. In a few moments Lord TOCHTACHIE
appeared, surrounded by kilted retainers, bearing torches, and
intoning in unison the mournful sporan of the clan. It was a weird and
awful sight. But HOLES, unemotional as ever, advanced at once to the
haughty Scotchman, before whose eye half a county was accustomed to
tremble, and, without any ado, addressed him thus: "My Lord, your
march has been stolen. Nay, do not interrupt me. Your guards are
careless, but not criminal--of that I can assure you. Here is the
stolen property; I restore it to you without cost." At this moment
the cart rumbled up, and ere the peer had time to utter a word, it had
discharged its contents into the middle of the yard. HOLES went on,
but in a lower voice, so as to be heard only by Lord TOCHTACHIE: "The
guilty party, my Lord, is your honoured father-in-law. He dare not,
he cannot, deny it. He is, I know, blind and deaf and dumb. These
qualities do not, however, exclude the possibility of crime. I have
just found these pieces of granite in his morning-room. The proof is
complete."

At this moment a shot was heard in the Castle, and directly afterwards
a frightened butler rushed up to his lordship and whispered to him.
"Ha! say you so?" almost screamed Lord TOCHTACHIE. "That amounts to a
confession. Mr. HOLES," he continued, "you have indeed rendered me a
service. My unfortunate, but guilty father-in-law has shot and missed
himself through the head. But in any ease the honour of the house is,
I know, safe in your hands."

I need hardly say that HOLES has never violated his lordship's
confidence, and the Daffshire peasants still speculate amongst
themselves upon the tortuous mystery of the march which was stolen and
restored.

    NOTE.--There is no proof positive given by any eye-witness
    whose veracity is unimpeachable of the death of the great
    amateur detective as it has been described in the _Strand
    Magazine_ for this month. _Where is the merry Swiss boy who
    delivered the note and disappeared?_ What was the symbolic
    meaning of the alpenstock with the hook at the end, left on
    the rock? Why, that he had _not_ "taken his hook." PICKLOCK
    HOLES has disappeared, but so have a great many other people.
    That he will turn up again no student of detective history and
    of the annals of crime can possibly doubt. Is it not probable
    that he has only dropped out of the _Strand Magazine_? And
    is it not equally probable that under some alias he will
    re-appear elsewhere?

_House of Commons, Friday, December 22._--House adjourned for
Christmas Recess; pleased to find that it will include the whole of
Christmas Day. Some talk of being satisfied with the Sunday, spending
Christmas Day in further pursuit of Parish Councils Bill. But after
deliberation decided to have a real good holiday on Christmas Day.
Came across SQUIRE OF MALWOOD just now. Was chalking up on door "Back
in ten minutes."

"It's a little more than that, of course, TOBY," he said. "But that
has business-like look. Am told it's what they do in the City before
going out for hasty luncheon."

[Illustration: Toby, M.P., enjoys his holiday.]

Enjoyed my holiday reading HERBERT MAXWELL'S life of OLD MORALITY
just published by BLACKWOOD. A difficult task; much easier to make
attractive book out of life of NAPOLEON BONAPARTE than with WILLIAM
HENRY SMITH as subject. That MAXWELL has succeeded appears from fact
that one leaves these volumes with warmer esteem and sincerer liking
for OLD MORALITY even than was born of close observation through
many Parliamentary sessions. MAXWELL has had full access to his
correspondence and journals. Uses them with great discretion; they
bring into mellow, clear light the capable, unselfish, courageous man,
ever following the loadstar of Duty. House of Commons used to smile
when OLD MORALITY, faced by any difficulty or dilemma, talked about
his "duty to his QUEEN and country." In his private letters he does
not put it in that oratorical form. But they are full of references
to the calls of duty. Stricken with a painful malady, worn in body and
wounded in spirit, OLD MORALITY still sturdily trod the narrow path.
There is little doubt that had he, two years before the end came,
retired from the Leadership of the House of Commons his genial
presence might have been with us to-day. But he was wanted at his
post, and he stuck to it.

Writing on the 17th March, 1889, he says: "We have trouble in
politics, and I am very weary. But I must go on doing my daily work as
best I can, looking for guidance and wisdom where alone it can be had
until my rest comes." This cry for rest was always sounding, through
day and night. A few weeks earlier he wrote to another friend: "I can
say God help me. He will take me out of my work when I am no longer
required, and then will come rest."

[Illustration: The last I saw of Harcourt.]

His last appearance in a semi-official capacity was in July, 1891,
when he went to Hatfield to meet the German Emperor. In the last
letter written to his wife he says, "Observing I looked tired last
night, Lady SALISBURY urged me to go to bed early: which I did." One
of his colleagues in the Cabinet, a fellow-guest at Hatfield on this
occasion, tells me he had occasion to know that OLD MORALITY was
in such pain he could not rest in his bed, spending the long night
walking about the room, with occasional rest in an arm-chair. Not
a word of this is written in the letter to Mrs. SMITH, in which he
reports that "everything has gone off wonderfully well to-day, which
must be very satisfactory to the Salisburys." Under his bourgeois
habit and unassuming manner W. H. SMITH modestly hid a chivalrous
mind and a noble nature. He had a kindly heart, too. But everyone knew
that, since he wore it on his sleeve.

_Business done._--Adjourned for so-called Christmas holidays. Think
I'll go and call on Lobengula. "Back in ten minutes," as the SQUIRE
says.

EDEPOL!

SIR,--"I'm all the way from Westminster," and the work I have to do
is to let you know about the Latin play performed there. PLAUTUS,
in truth, is not a wildly exciting writer, and there is in the
_Trinummus_ a tameness which, extending, as it does, through five
acts, becomes almost oppressive at the end. The young actors looked
well and enunciated clearly, and one of them, Mr. J. F. WATERS, showed
considerable ability as an actor. But we don't go to the College
of St. Peter at Westminster merely to see the play. There are other
interests. It is pleasant to watch the Old Westminsters rubbing
recollections with one another between the acts, and endeavouring
gallantly during the performance to keep their rusty Latin abreast of
the various situations. Laughter in a Latin play straggles. It is like
a dropping fire of musketry. A Westminster master probably leads
it off; various intelligent veterans take it up dutifully, and the
ladies, bless their unlatinised minds, follow faintly towards the
end. If a London manager wants applause in his theatre let him hire a
contingent of small Westminster boys. They have attained to absolute
perfection in the arts of the _claque_. At no Paris Theatre is it
better done. The epilogue showed a pretty wit and a high degree of
skill in the management of hexameter and pentameter. No one could have
believed that the Kodak advertisement, "you press the button, we do
the rest," would have made so good a Latin line. Much pleased, and so
to bed.

  Yours,      A VAGRANT.

NEW YEAR'S EVE AT LATTERDAY HALL.

(_An Incident._)

SCENE I.--_Library in Latterday Hall_, Sir LYON TAYMER'S _Country
House_. Sir LYON TAYMER _discovered fuming by the mantelpiece, while
his_ Secretary _is glancing over some correspondence_.

_Sir Lyon_ (_irritably_). Here--I suppose you will have to answer
this.

_Secretary._ What is that, Sir LYON?

_Sir Lyon._ You know how anxious I am that my New Year's party
should be a success. A whole heap of celebrities are coming, and,
notwithstanding the immense expense, I engaged a party of Ghosts to
amuse them. Now I have just had a telepathic communication from these
Shadows of Shades--(that's all they are--only Ghosts of departed
heroes and heroines in fiction)--asking whether they're to be treated
on an equality with the other guests, or as mere entertainers! Did you
ever hear of such impertinence! The spokesman--I should say, perhaps,
the Spooksman--is, of all people in the other world, the VICAR OF
WAKEFIELD. A clergyman too! It's quite inconsistent; and so snobbish!

_Secretary._ Dear Sir LYON, excuse me, but it's perfectly natural that
Ghosts should be a little sensitive on the social question. Remember,
for years they were ignored, or looked upon as mountebanks. It is
really only of late that there has been all this excitement about
them, so it is not surprising they are anxious to be taken seriously.

_Sir Lyon._ Well, I suppose I am old-fashioned, but it seems to me
quite ridiculous. These infernal Ghosts give themselves as many airs
as though they were--the Blue Hungarians, at least.

_Secretary._ Ah, from a band we might expect airs. But I should advise
you very strongly, Sir _Lyon_, to treat them as friends. You _must_ be
up to date.

_Sir Lyon_ (_with disgust_). Allow them to dine--perhaps to
_dance_--with my guests?

_Secretary_ (_with calmness_). Certainly they will have to dine; and,
as to dancing, of course they _must_, if they're received on an equal
_footing_.

    [_Smiles to himself at his joke._

_Sir Lyon._ Oh--well--I suppose I must give in. Let them know at once,
and for heaven's sake mind they're punctual.

    [_Scene closes as the Secretary hastily seizes a slate,
    and automatically writes to the Ghosts a very cordial and
    courteously-worded invitation._

[Illustration: Dorian Gray taking Juliet in to dinner.]

SCENE II.--_New Year's Eve at Latterday Hall. In the magnificent
dining-room are seated at dinner a large, well-known, and incongruous
company. The Ghosts are chatting away in the most genial manner
with the living distinguished people, and positively making the
"celebrities" quite "at home."_ DANIEL DERONDA _shows a marked liking
for_ DODO, _whom he has taken to dinner, and is indulging in a light
and airy flirtation with her, which takes a form peculiar to himself_.

_Daniel Deronda_ (_earnestly_). Who has ever pinched into its pilulous
smallness the cobweb of matrimonial duty? Honesty is surely the
broadest basis of joy in life.

_Dodo_ (_a modern Detail in accordion pleating, subject to morbid fits
of irrelevant skirt-dancing_). Oh, Mr. DERONDA, what a silly girl I
am! I can't bear that proverb about "Honesty being the best policy."
It sounds like a sort of life Insurance.

    [_Giggles contemporarily._ DORIAN GRAY _having taken_ JULIET
    _to dinner, and not getting on with her very well, is staring
    with unfeigned horror at_ ROCHESTER, _opposite, who is
    bullying_ JANE EYRE _to a pitiable extent. Behind him is a
    screen of gilt Spanish leather, wrought with a rather florid
    Louis Seize design and encrusted with pearls, moonstones, and
    large green emeralds_.

_Dorian_ (_aside, to_ Young Subaltern, _who has come Home. On leave.
For Christmas_). Who _is_ that dreadful man?

_Young Subaltern._ Who? Old ROCHESTER? Oh, he's a Plain Hero. From the
past. He's all right. How well you're looking! Younger than ever, by
Jove! Which is curious. But why that absurd buttonhole?

_Dorian_ (_hurt_). You never like anything I wear. You Anglo-Indians
are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.

    [_Arranges his fringe in an old Dutch-silver mirror on the
    opposite mantelpiece, framed in curiously-carved ivory Cupids,
    and studded with precious stones, chiefly opals, sapphires,
    and chrysoberyls._

_Ethel Newcome_ (_to_ Secretary). Who are those two pretty American
girls? They seem to be attracting a great deal of attention. (_I_ am
completely forgotten, I notice.) Do their dresses come from Paris?

_Secretary._ No. I think not, dear Miss NEWCOME. From Messrs. HOWELLS
AND JAMES, I fancy.

_Richard Feverel_ (_cheerily, across the table to_ Mr. PICKWICK).
In tolerance of some dithyrambic inebriety--quiverings of
semi-narration--we seem to be entering the circle of a most magnetic
pseudo-polarity. Don't we?

_Mr. Pickwick_ (_puzzled_). Very kind of you to say so, I'm sure. May
I have the pleasure of taking wine with you?

    [_Dinner proceeds with animation._ BOOTLES' Baby, Little JIM,
    PAUL DOMBEY, _and the_ Heavenly Twins _come in to dessert, and
    are more or less troublesome_.

_Sir Lyon_ (_aside, to_ Secretary, _when the ladies have retired_).
I say, you know I am afraid this is going to hang fire. It's nothing
less than a miracle for a social affair to go off well when the people
are not in the same set. Old PICKWICK's been asking for "a wassail
bowl." I haven't got such a thing about me; and I should have thought
'74 champagne would have been good enough, but he says it's like our
humour--_too new_! The children are bothering to know why there isn't
a Christmas-tree.

_Secretary._ Tell them to go to the--Haymarket. The reward will
be--swift. Might I suggest mistletoe? I should be very pleased to go
under it with Madame BOVARY, just to show the others how to----

_Sir Lyon_ (_stiffly_). Much obliged, but I will not give you that
trouble. If _anyone_ goes under the mistletoe with Madame BOVARY it
will be myself. Remember that.

_Secretary._ Oh, certainly! I merely meant----How about
crackers? I could set the thing going by pulling one with Miss OLIVIA.
The old Vicar said just now, in his pointed, Gothic way, something
about times having changed, and----

_Sir Lyon._ Yes, we'll have crackers, but you can leave _me_ to pull
the first one with Miss OLIVIA. It would look better. Perhaps we'd
better let the Ghosts give their entertainment now--eh?

_Secretary._ I'll arrange it at once.

SCENE III.--_In the Hall, in which is a temporary theatre; all the
Modern Celebrities are seated on rows of chairs, chattering, flirting,
and discussing Insomnia and the New Criticism. Behind the scenes the
Ghosts are disputing as to which shall recite first, the order of
precedence depending entirely on the question as to which is the most
completely defunct. Finally_, ERNEST MALTRAVERS _and_ TOM JONES _go on
together, and the Curtain goes up_.

_Ernest Maltravers_ (_musingly, in a low yet ringing voice, in which
Pride struggles with Emotion_). Let us learn, from yon dinner-table,
o'er which brooded the spirits of the Novelists of all time, to lift
ourselves on the wings of Romanticism back to Bombastic and Primeval
Prose. (_Breaks off suddenly. Aside, to_ TOM JONES.) I cannot go on
like this. We ought to have had a _scenario_.

_Tom Jones_ (_suppressing laughter, aside_). Why, thou foolish
scoundrel, is there not one in front? How else could be seated there
so many fair ladies and gallant gentlemen?

_Ernest Maltravers_ (_aside_). In the contemplation of your idiocy, I
curb with difficulty the impulse that leads me to crush the life from
your bosom. Know, Ignorant One, that a _scenario_ is not the same
thing as an auditorium.

    [TOM JONES _is about to attack him with fine old English
    violence, when the curtain suddenly falls. The entertainment
    is interrupted. The audience appear at once amused and
    shocked._ DORIAN_ takes out his little vinaigrette exquisitely
    set with turquoises, cymophanes, amethysts, and tourmalines,
    and offers it to the_ Subaltern, _who, evidently unaware of
    its use, pockets it._

_Subaltern._ You got that out of a cracker, didn't you? I'll take it
Home. For the kids.

    [_The entr'acte is growing so prolonged that the_ Secretary
    _goes behind the scenes to know the cause of the delay. He
    finds all confusion. The party has been increased by the
    presence of_ Mr. STEAD'S Spook JULIA, _who, having half an
    hour to spare, has come to protest against the "indignity"
    as she calls it, of fine old crusted Ghosts being expected to
    perform to a lot of mere modern myths. She speaks with such
    eloquence that she persuades them, one and all, to leave
    without finishing their performance and entirely without
    ceremony. Nothing the_ Secretary _can say has any effect, and
    they all vanish, leaving "not a wrack behind," except, a slate
    pencil JULIA has dropped in her excitement_.

_Sir Lyon_ (_after hearing the news_). Shameful! Never again will I
have a Ghost in this house. This is what comes of treating them as
equals! I'll--I'll--I'll write to the Psychical Society!

    [_Scene closes as all the guests crowd round him and ask him
    to drink the health of Modern Fiction and--The New Year._

"Sir," said a wisely deferential friend of the Baron's, approaching
the Baronial arm-chair wherein sat His Super-Excellency regaling
himself in truly Regal-Cole-ian fashion, "Sir, I present to your
notice a book entitled _In Search of a Climate_." "With such a title,"
quoth the Baron, in poetic humour, "it should have been dedicated
to His Grace of Canterbury. Would not this distich well favour the
title-page? Listen:--

  "'In Search of a Climate,' | From CHARLES B. NOTTAGE,
  This to the Primate!       | Who lives in a cottage."

"W. A.," or "The Wisely Appreciative," went into wisely appreciative
ecstasies. "Baron," he presently resumed, "you will be graciously
pleased to read it." "I will recline on my sofa," returned the
Baron, "and, in that position, do my level best." So saying, His
Super-Excellency suited the action to the word, and, waving his hand
in token that he was not to be disturbed for the space of some forty
winks or more, he bent his head in silent study o'er the somewhat
bulky volume. "One of the most interesting and instructive chapters in
this excellently elaborated book of reference," said the Baron, some
time afterwards--"a book full of 'wise saws and modern instances'--is
that headed 'Religion and Rum,' whence it appears that, whatever
form of worship the Natives from time to time might adopt, it always
included the cult of spirits in some form or other. The title of this
chapter," observed the Baron, judicially, "instead of 'Religion
and Rum,' should rather have been 'Rum Religions, or Spirituous
Influences.' Towards the close of the book the author still seems to
be _In Search of a Climate_. But what sort of a climate does he seek?
One to suit everybody? Why, like the distinguished individual who was
'terribly disappointed with the Atlantic,' there are people, quoted
as testimony above proof by Mr. NOTTAGE, of the Cottage, who were
'all terribly disappointed with the climate of Santa Barbara and Los
Angeles.' Well, then," quoth the Baron, "try Margate and Ramsgate."
The book, attractively got up, is published by the firm whose name
always recalls to the Baron's verse-atile mind that delightful poem
set to dulcet music yclept "_Soft and Low, Soft and Low_," only that
the names are SAMP-SON Low, Low & Co., which, set to the same strain,
will "do as well." "And," quoth the Baron, suddenly inspired, "what a
series of songs for Publishers and Bookbinders might be written! For
example, _'My Mother bids me bind my books!' 'I am inter-leaving
thee in sorrow.' Cum multis aliis suggestionibus!_ But this is
_délassement_. Let our toast be, 'Our noble Shelves!'--'our noble
Book-shelves!'" explains the Baron, gaily; and so back to the Brown
Study where, as Baron BROWN BEARD, he disposes of the various heads
in his department, and signs himself, THE JUST AND GENEROUS BARON DE
BOOK-WORMS.

"THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT."

(_Passages from a Political "Christmas Carol" of the Period
descriptive of a slumbering Stateman's Yule-Tide Dream._)


Awaking in the middle of a prodigiously sonorous snore, and sitting up
on what seemed to be a nightmare-like blend of the Treasury Bench and
his own bed, to get his thoughts together, SADSTONE (like _Scrooge_)
had no occasion to be told that Big Ben was again upon the stroke of
Twelve.

Now, being prepared for almost anything--from J-SS-E C-LL-NGS to
a Vote of Censure--he was not by any means prepared for Nothing!
Consequently, when the bell boomed its twelfth stroke, and nothing
appeared, or happened--not even a nightmare in the shape of T-MMY
B-WL-S, or a Motion for Adjournment--he was taken with a fit of the
shivers.

At last he began to think that the source and centre of the ghostly
light which seemed to gleam on him from nowhere in particular, might
be in the adjoining room, his own private Downing Street _sanctum_.
Thence indeed, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea
taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in
his slippers to the door.

The moment SADSTONE'S hand was on the lock, a strange voice called him
by his name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.

It was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had
undergone a surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were
so hung with shamrock green and shillelagh branches that it looked
a perfect Grove of Blarney. A lurid blaze, like a blue-tongued
snapdragon flare, went hissing up the chimney, revealing in weird
glimpses on the heated hearth and chimney tiles spectral figures of
impish design and menacing gesture. Heaped up on the floor, to form a
kind of throne, were Blue Books, abortive Bills, scrolls on which
were inscribed endless questions and unnumbered amendments; bundles of
party papers and political pamphlets; pallid sucking-pigs that seemed
to demand rather opportune interment than human digestion; long
wreaths of sausage-like shackles; resurrection pies of indigestible
crust and full of offal scraps and tainted "block ornaments";
pudding-shaped bombs; barrels of explosives and fulminants; red hot
(political) "chestnuts" of the most hackneyed partisan sort; Dead-Sea
apples of the dustiest kind, savouring of sand and strife; fiery
looking Ulster oranges; belated (parliamentary) pairs, and seething
bowls of raw and vitriolic party spirit, that made the chamber dim,
dank, and malodorous with their heady steam. In uneasy state upon this
extraordinary conglomerate couch or throne, there sat an ogreish giant
of pantomimic size and bogeyishly menacing expression, portentous to
see; who bore a smokily-flaring torch, in shape not unlike an Anarch's
beacon or Fury's bale-fire, and held it up, high up, to shed its lurid
light on SADSTONE, as he came peeping round the door.

"Come in!" exclaimed the Ghoul-Ghost. "Come in, and know me better,
(G. O.) Man!"

SADSTONE entered timidly, and hung his head before the Spirit. He was
hardly the dogged SADSTONE he had been, and the Spirit's eyes were so
glowering and ungenial, he did not like to meet them.

"I am the Spirit of Christmas Present," said the apparition. "Look
upon me!"

SADSTONE sorrowfully did so. It was clothed in one simple
emerald-green robe or mantle, bordered with buff fur of the dull
tint dear to the old Scotch Whig. This garment hung so loosely on
the figure that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to
be warded or concealed by any artifice. On its head it wore no other
covering than a wreath of shamrock, set here and there with a thistle.
Its dull black curls were long and elf-like and weird; weird as its
frowning face, its staring eye, its clenched hand, its raucous voice,
its despotic demeanour, and its gloomy air. Girded round its middle
was an antique scabbard, holding a huge two-handed sword; the
blade, ready to leap from its sheath, seemed a most unsuitable and
unseasonable adjunct to what mankind has been wont to regard as the
gentle and genial Spirit of Peace and Goodwill.

"You have never seen the like of _Me_ before!" exclaimed the Spirit.

"_Ne-e-ver!_" SADSTONE made answer to it, in accents stammering
somewhat, yet most emphatic.

DISTORTED MERCY.

[Illustration: IT] _is New Year's Eve. In a comfortable arm-chair
by the fire sits the_ Metropolitan Magistrate. _He smiles in
self-complacency. He speaks:--_

This year I have most faithfully fulfilled my duty; the spirit of
sweet leniency has marked my every sentence--at least toward the more
flagitious and inhuman offender. Thus have I, in place of punishing,
won over to more virtuous ways; so may I doze the cheerful,
self-admiring doze of virtue.

    [_He dozes. Gathering from the comfortable reflections of the
    fire and lamp thrown from the polished furniture, a radiant
    form shapes itself at his elbow. The_ Magistrate _smiles in
    his sleep, in great content_.

_The Metropolitan Magistrate._ Who art thou, visitant?

_The Form._ I am the Spirit of thy Leniency. I come to show thee
how fair and flattering a result thy milder sentences--to wit, those
passed upon the more outrageous culprits--have yielded. See! (_Waves
a wand._) This is he who came before thy judgment seat for--after
repeated warning--selling milk from premises teeming with scarlet
fever. Thou didst say, "_It is the grossest, and most shocking case
of brutal disregard for human life I ever heard!_" and thereupon didst
fine him half-a-crown--the minimum penalty.

_M. Mag._ (_with affectionate interest_). And since? How farest now,
thou naughty one?

_Milk Criminal._ O most blessed Magistrate and sweet Your Worship, I
fare most happily; for, most comfortably encouraged by your gracious
leniency, I did redouble--nay, multiply an hundred times--mine efforts
to disseminate disease; so that I may, without undue boasting, claim
to be father of an epidemic that felled its hundreds. And further, in
the doing of this I have heaped up a most goodly pile of gold. Give me
your blessing, most sympathetic Your Worship!

_M. Mag._ (_recoiling_). Nay; mine intentions looked not toward so
dire result! I cannot bless----

_The Spirit._ How, good Stipendiary? Dost thou now disown me, thine
own Spirit? Thou must surely bless thy _protégé_, him who but carries
out thy methods to their logical result! And see, I summon others of
thy choice; this good butcher who hath sent unwholesome meat to
London to feed the poor. Thou didst say of him, "_A most inhuman,
ill-conditioned knave and rascal; a constructive homicide! I will not
imprison him, but fine him seven shillings._" And again, see this good
rough who kicked a constable nearly to death; thou saidst of him, "_A
miscreant unfit to live. A savage worse than any tiger! One shilling
fine._" Then finding he could not pay without foregoing his accustomed
gin, thy heart relented, and thou didst discharge him. Then again,
here have we this fair hawker who kicked his donkey's legs and so
belaboured him with cudgels that he left no bone unbroken; thou
saidst of him, "_An act more horrible and sickening could scarce be
perpetrated by a fiend!_" Then, with a gentle caution, thou didst set
him free.

_M. Mag._ But tell me, prithee, what the outcome was of these my
leniences. Did results not justify----?

_The Butcher._ Oh, yes, indeed, in my case! Taking courage, seeing
that justice was so linked with mercy, I did extend most energetically
my little venture in unwholesome meat, and now am rich, and have been
made a lord.

_The Rough._ And since your clemency, O sweet your Worship, I've
kicked to death some dozens of assorted victims--policemen, girls, and
infants.

_The Hawker._ And I----

_M. Mag._ (_writhing_). Oh, peace, and spare me! Get ye gone!

_The Criminals._ What? This is passing strange! You will not bless the
work yourself have fostered?

_M. Mag._ (_tearing his hair_). _I_ fostered? _I_, the gentle
magistrate, the soul of clemency----?

_The Spirit._ Come, bless thy chosen clients!

    [_With a shriek the_ Metropolitan Magistrate _awakes from
    his doze. He is haggard; his eye is bloodshot with horror. He
    speaks, shuddering:--_

What are these hideous crimes that I have done, mistaking them for
mercy? How unworthy am I to touch so sweet an attribute, distorting
and most basely turning it from its appointed course! There chime the
bells. Let them proclaim how, in the coming year they usher in, I
will essay to win this fair, sweet attribute entrusted to me, and so
misshapen by my cruelties, back to her rightful form! I will begin by
showing mercy unto Mercy's self.

A STUDY IN BROWN.

  I've caught you, hazel-eyed brunette, day-dreaming, chin on hand!
  Don't think, now, that my stolen sketch is bold and contraband!
    Nay, rather, 'tis the _duty_ that's imposed on ev'ry beauty,
  To grant that with respectful glance her profile may be scanned.

  To picture such a wealth of brown would VANDYCK'S self delight;
  Brown eyes I see, and waving hair, brown as a summer night.
    _I_ cannot do you justice, but this thumb-nail sketch, I trust, is
  A deep brown-study rendered into simple black and white.

  In reverie reflective, has your wayward fancy strayed,
  It may be, to last summer's tryst in some wild English glade,
    Or old-world forest-garden, where, like _Rosalind_ in Arden,
  Your troth you plighted, or, love-lorn, outmourned the Nut-brown Maid?

  [Illustration]

  You're wand'ring in Mahatma-land, and counting astral sheep?
  And gathering wool that never grew, a Brownie-led _Bo-peep_,
    Or, possibly, pursuant of an Ego playing truant.
  And lost amid the labyrinth of dim hypnotic sleep?

  For all I know, you're musing in this meditative trance
  On modern and sublunar joys, as dinner, dress, and dance!
    Or is it _toothache_ merely that--well, makes you stare so queerly?
  (Somehow I ne'er _can_ draw the line 'twixt bathos and romance!)

  If thus I seem inquisitive, don't kill me with a frown!
  Though times are hard, in vulgar phrase, I'll plank my money down!
    Your train of thought to share (if you'll accept a penny-tariff),
  I tender, with my compliments, the coin that's called a "brown"!

TO MR. PUNCH,--Sir,--I appeal to you. Ought scientific papers to be
allowed to publish incitements to bloodshed and anarchy? I have just
read in one an enthusiastic commendation of "an agitator working at
280 revolutions per minute." This agitator is, it appears, closely
connected with an "annihilator." It is true that the annihilator is a
smoke-annihilator, and the agitator is part of its machinery; but who
knows what influence may be exerted upon weak minds at such a time as
this by the use of these awful terms? Is the Home Secretary asleep?

MYSTERIOUS.--In _Sala's Journal_ for December 13 the advertisement of
the Christmas Number announces that "arrangements have been made for
publishing the Portraits of the Contributors at the commencement of
their respective articles. This, it is believed, will prove a very
interesting feature." No doubt. But _which_ "feature," and _whose_
"feature," and to which contributor will "the very interesting
feature" in the portrait belong? They cannot surely have only one
feature among them! Among the special contributors, each of course
with distinctive features, are Sir AUGUSTUS HARRIS, Mr. SUTHERLAND
EDWARDS, Mr. ARTHUR À BECKETT, and Mr. DAVENPORT ADAMS. Excellent
company each, with most interesting features. But which feature is to
be taken as representing the lot? "Nose?" Well, there's point in that.
"Cheek?" Ahem! Will it be "All their eye?" Evidently the only way
of satisfying curiosity is to purchase a copy of _S. J.'s_ Christmas
Number.
